This is a pure Python implementation of the [rsync algorithm] [TM96].
Updated to use SHA256 hashing (instead of the standard implementation
which uses outdated MD5 hashes), and packages for disutils
distribution by Isis Lovecruft, <isis@patternsinthevoid.net>. The
majority of the code is blatantly stolen from Eric Pruitt's code
as posted on [ActiveState] [1].
