    Starting with this release, the naming of OpenStack resources created
    during backup and restore procedures changes. This affects both
    temporary resources as well as final resources resulting from restore
    actions.

    Server, volume and image resources restored from backup will receive a
    timestamp suffix to their name, preceeded by a tilde (``~``) character,
    e.g., "my-server~1769185234". The timestamp is the backup timestamp of
    the backup that has been restored.
    This avoids duplicate names of resources with different historical states
    and makes restored resources easier to discern.

    A new job configuration option ``temp_resource_prefix`` and corresponding
    **freezer-agent** command-line flag ``--temp-resource-prefix`` is
    introduced. It defaults to ``freezer_``.

    Temporary resources (snapshots, images, volumes) created during **backup**
    operations will receive a ``freezer_backup_`` prefix to their name.
    Temporary resources (snapshots, images, volumes) created during **restore**
    operations will receive a ``freezer_restore_`` prefix to their name.
    The ``freezer_`` part can be configured using the new
    ``temp_resource_prefix`` option.

    All temporary resources created by Freezer that historically did not
    receive a name (resulting in the name being "None") will now receive
    proper naming as described above.
