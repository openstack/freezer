prelude: >
    Up to now, Freezer offered two options for job configurations called
    ``incremental`` and ``no_incremental``. Both options could be set
    independently from one another and defaulted to conflicting values.
    The ``freezer-agent`` CLI offered conflicting ``--noincremental`` and
    ``--no-incremental`` flags, which were interpreted differently.
    Parts of the backup and restore procedures were using one option and other
    parts the other option, leading to inconsistent behavior.
    With this release the ``no_incremental`` option and corresponding
    ``--no-incremental`` flag are removed.
    Users can instead set ``incremental`` to ``false`` in jobs or use the
    ``--noincremental`` flag in the agent to achieve the same behavior.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``no_incremental`` option for Freezer jobs and the
    ``--no-incremental`` flag for the ``freezer-agent`` CLI have been removed.
    They are functionally replaced with setting the existing ``incremental``
    job option to ``false`` or using the existing ``--noincremental`` flag
    respectively.
