To learn how to use Freezer's API, consult the documentation available online
at:

- `Backup API Reference <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/backup/>`__
- `Freezer API <https://opendev.org/openstack/freezer-api>`__

Freezer Horizon plugin:
- `Freezer Web UI <https://opendev.org/openstack/freezer-web-ui>`__

For more information on OpenStack APIs, SDKs and CLIs in general, refer to:

Operators
---------

To learn how to deploy and configure OpenStack Freezer, consult the
documentation available online at:

- `OpenStack Freezer <https://docs.openstack.org/freezer/latest/>`__

In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should be reported to
the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained the software from a 3rd party
operating system vendor, it is often wise to use their own bug tracker for
reporting problems. In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
available at:

- `Bug Tracker <https://launchpad.net/freezer>`__

Troubleshooting
---------------

When errors occure, these are good places to check:

* freezer-api log: `$HOME/log/freezer-api.log`
                   `/var/log/apache2/freezer-api.log`
* freezer-agent log: `$HOME/.freezer/freezer.log`
* freezer-scheduler log:`/var/log/freezer/scheduler.log`

Developers
----------

Any new code must follow the development guidelines detailed in the HACKING.rst
file and OpenStack general development guidelines, and pass all unit tests.

Further developer focused documentation is available at:

- `Official Freezer Documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/freezer/latest/>`__
- `Official Client Documentation
  <https://docs.openstack.org/python-freezerclient/latest/>`__
